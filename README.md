### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a BachelorÂ´s Degree in Information Systems and work as a software developer/IT Manager.  I am passionate about games. I am always seeking out more knowledge in the technology area, trying to help others whenever possible as well.

I have already collaborated to a _Health/Social_ Tech startup. I hope one day to contribute on an educational or another social project.
