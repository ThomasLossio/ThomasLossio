# 👋 Hello! I'm Thomas

I'm a software developer with a degree in Information Systems and a strong passion for building useful and reliable systems. I currently work as a Developer and IT Manager in the notarial and registry domain in Brazil.

🛠 I work primarily with **Delphi**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **REST APIs**, and I'm currently deepening my knowledge in **cloud-based integrations**.

🎮 Gamer by heart, I love digging into the logic behind systems — whether it's for building tools, improving UX, or just exploring ideas.

📚 Currently learning and evolving through:
- Clean and modern code practices in legacy Delphi systems
- Software architecture and automation for high-availability systems
- Cloud storage, APIs, and CI/CD integration workflows

🌱 I believe in learning by building. One step at a time.

🤝 I'm always happy to exchange knowledge or contribute when I can.
